process

1. find color range for white and green tiles
    - for each, color the screen white and black to find contours
2. find the contours 
3. draw a box around the contours 
    - we need some parememters
    - the box will be limted to a specific size 
    - we also need to check if the box being drawn is already within another box (this happens if there is a letter)

4. We need to sort the green and white boxes bases on position
    - make an allowence because they we always be perfect
